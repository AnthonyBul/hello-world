Approximately three-fourths of cars and trucks surveyed by Consumer Reports in 2017 have forward-collision detection as either a standard or an optional feature. These vehicles can detect obstacles – including pedestrians – and stop or avoid hitting them. By 2022, emergency braking will be required in all vehicles sold in the U.S.

Safety features in today’s cars include lane-departure warnings, adaptive cruise control and various types of collision avoidance. All of these systems involve multiple sensors, such as radars and cameras, tracking what’s going on around the car. Most of the time, they run passively, not communicating with the driver nor taking control of the car. But when certain events occur – such as approaching a pedestrian or an obstacle – these systems spring to life.
